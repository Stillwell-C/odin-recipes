    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Miyeokguk</strong> is a simple, but very tasty and healthy dish. It's a very common soup, and something Koreans always eat on their birthday.</p>
    <p>There are a number of different kinds of seaweed available at a Korean grocery store. Dried <em>miyeok</em> is hard to the touch and it's deep dark green makes it appear almost black. Just make sure the packaging says "miyeok" to avoid the other kinds of seaweed.</p>
    <p>Note that Koreans often use a large spoon to measure things instead of a tablespoon measuring spoon. You may want to slightly reduce the amounts of tbsp if using a tablespoon measure or just use one of your larger spoons, such as soup or table spoon.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12g Dried miyeok</li>
        <li>100g Beef brisket (or skirt steak)</li>
        <li>2tbsp Korean soup sauce (or 1tbsp standard soy sauce)</li>
        <li>1tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>2tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1.5l water</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the miyeok in water for 20-30 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove the miyeok from the water and squeeze to remove some of the water.</li>
        <li>Cut the miyeok into 3-4cm long pieces.</li>
        <li>Cut the beef into small bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan over medium heat. When the pan comes to temperature, add in sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Add the beef to the pan and fry until the pieces begin to turn brown. Add in the miyeok and fry together.</li>
        <li>Once the miyeok beings to develop a deeper color, add in the water and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Boil the soup for at least 30 minutes. Boiling for longer will improve the texture and make for a much better soup. Try boiling your soup for one to one and a half hours. You may need to add more liquid as necessary.</li>
        <li>Add in the minced garlic, and soy sauce, and salt. Taste for seasoning. Once the soup returns to a boil, remove from heat and serve.</li>
    </ol>
